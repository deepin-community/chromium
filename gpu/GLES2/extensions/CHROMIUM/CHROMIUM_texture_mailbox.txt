Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

Overview

    This extension defines a way of sharing texture image data between texture
    objects in different contexts where the contexts would not normally share
    texture resources. One new function is exported.
    glCreateAndConsumeTextureCHROMIUM associates the texture object referenced
    by a mailbox name to a texture name.

New Procedures and Functions

    GLuint glCreateAndConsumeTextureCHROMIUM (const GLbyte *mailbox)

    Returns a new texture name pointing to the texture object associated with
    the mailbox name. Does not alter the texture bindings or alter the currently
    bound texture in any way. All the contexts that have consumed the texture
    object, as well as produced it share the texture object, as if the contexts
    were part of the share group. The texture object is deleted once all
    contexts have deleted the texture name associated with the texture object,
    and detached it from all framebuffer objects as well as texture unit
    bindings. See Appendix C of the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification for details
    relative to visibility in one context of changes to the shared texture
    object in another context.

    If glCreateAndConsumeTextureCHROMIUM generates an error, the new texture
    name remains unbound.  It is treated in the same way as a new texture name
    returned by GenTextures.

    INVALID_OPERATION is generated if <mailbox> is not associated with a texture
    object.
